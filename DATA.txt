Scope:
The scope of this predictor is to improve the quality of the result of diagnosis related to colonoscopies.

Variables:

quality: a measure of the quality of the recorded video. (numerical)
bits: number of bits used to encode that block in the video stream. (numerical)
intra_parts: number sub-blocks inside this block that are not encoded by making use of
information in other frames.(numerical)
skip_parts: number sub-blocks inside this block that are straight-forward copied from another
frame.(numerical)
inter_16x16_parts: number of sub-blocks inside this block making use of information in other
frames and whose size is 16x16 pixels.(numerical)
inter_4x4_parts: number of sub-blocks inside this block making use of information in other
frames and whose size is 4x4 pixels.(numerical)
inter_other_parts: number of sub-blocks inside this block making use of information in other
frames and whose size is different from 16x16 and 4x4 pixels.(numerical)
non_zero_pixels: number of pixels different from 0 after encoding the block. (numerical)
frame_width: the width of the video frame in pixels.(numerical)
frame_height: the height of the video frame in pixels. (numerical)
movement_level: a measure of the level of movement of this frame with respect the previous
one.(numerical)
mean: mean of the pixels of the encoded block.(numerical)
sub_mean_1: mean of the pixels contained in the first 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.(numerical)
sub_mean_2: mean of the pixels contained in the second 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.(numerical)
sub_mean_3: mean of the pixels contained in the third 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.(numerical)
sub_mean_4: mean of the pixels contained in the fourth 32x32 sub-bock of the current block.(numerical)
var_sub_blocks: variance of the four previous values.(numerical)
sobel_h: mean of the pixels of the encoded block after applying the Sobel operator in
horizontal direction.(numerical)
sobel_v: mean of the pixels of the encoded block after applying the Sobel operator in vertical
direction.(numerical)
variance: variance of the pixels of the encoded block.(numerical)
block_movement_h: a measure of the movement of the current block in the horizontal
direction.(numerical)
block_movement_v: a measure of the movement of the current block in the vertical direction.(numerical)
var_movement_h: a measure of the variance of the movements inside the current block in the
horizontal direction.(numerical)
var_movement_v: a measure of the variance of the movements inside the current block in the
vertical direction.(numerical)
cost_1: a measure of the cost of encoding this block without partitioning it.(numerical)
cost_2: a measure of the cost of encoding this block without partitioning it and without
considering any movement in it.(numerical)
relevant: the target variable that indicates whether the current block is relevant (1) or not (0).(numerical)
